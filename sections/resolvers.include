<h2 id="resolvers">The <dfn interface>IMusicService</dfn> resolver system </h2>
<p>In order to be able to play the playlist, the browser must be able to resolve the <{song}> elements to authorized music services, and play through their APIs. Music services are integrated into music browser through implementations of the {{IMusicService}} class, either in native or JavaScript code, provided as plug-ins for the user agent.</p>

<em>This section is non-normative</em>

<p>To allow playbacks from <{song}> elements, songs services can create plugins containing implementions of {{IMusicService}} interface in user-installable plugins which resolves the tracks to the particular service and allows instant playback</p>
